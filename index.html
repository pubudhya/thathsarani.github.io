                <td><p>Any reptile with a bone shell covering its body, such as tortoises, is a turtle (member of the order Testudines).
                    Despite the fact that many creatures, including mammals and invertebrates, have developed shells, none have a design like that of turtles.
                    There is a top (carapace) and a bottom (plastron) to the turtle's shell.
                    In Sri Lanka, the following turtle species can be observed.

<td><p>Loggerhead: Adults are carnivores who prefer crabs, whelks, and conchs; hatchlings are omnivores (eating both plants and animals).
    <br>

    Green: Sea turtles at maturity are herbivores who prefer to stay around on coral reefs where they may pick at algae and seagrass. However, 
    hatchlings are omnivorous.</p></td>

<h3>Why Turtles are Important?</h3>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <p>Hawksbills live on coral reefs and are known for only consuming a few types of sea sponges. The variety of life on the reef is increased by this diet, which enables the growth of uncommon forms of sponges.Without Hawksbills, sponges might overgrow, suffocate, and kill slow-growing corals. The Hawksbill's 
              position on the reef has grown even more important as it faces increasing threats from climate change and other negative factors. </p>
              <p>Additionally, sea turtles benefit the water. 
          By laying their eggs on the sand, sea turtles that are nesting benefit beaches.
          Eggshells and unhatched eggs that are left behind supply vital nutrients that feed beach grasses and other dune flora, 
          which stabilizes dunes and helps prevent 
          coastal erosion.

            </ol>

<h4>Are Turtles Dangered?</h4>

<table>
    <tr>

        <td><img src="turtles15.jpeg" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 700px;"></td>
        <td>
<p>Although they have been present for millions of years, sea turtles are currently considered an endangered and vulnerable species of marine creatures due to recent behaviors along the coastline that have considerably contributed to their dwindling populations.
<p>Unsafe fishing methods are among the most significant causes of sea turtle endangerment.Some of them are Coastal development and pollution,global warming,unlicensed harvesting and trading.</p>
