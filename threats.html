    <td><p>Although sea turtles are revered in many cultures throughout the world for their mythological or spiritual significance, this hasn't stopped people from eating their eggs or flesh.
         Sea turtles have served as a source of food for many coastal cultures, particularly in Central America and Asia. 
        Turtle hunters search the beaches at night during the nesting season in search of nesting females.
        <br>
        <br> They frequently wait until after the female has laid her eggs before killing her. They then take the meat and the eggs.
         People may also utilize the oil, cartilage, skin, and shell of the turtle as well as other components of the animal to make items. Although many nations prohibit the collecting of eggs, enforcement is generally low, illicit harvest is widespread, and the eggs are frequently found for sale in local markets.

    <h3>Illegal Sea Turtle Shell Trade</h3>

            <p>Since ancient times, hawksbill sea turtles have been hunted for their exquisite gold and brown shells, which are used to make jewelry and other high-end goods.
                 These turtles are now classified as severely endangered as a result. Hawksbill numbers are thought to have decreased by 90% during the previous 100 years, according to scientists.
                  Although illicit trading is the main reason for this reduction, there is still a need for shells on the black market today.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Many visitors unknowingly assist the worldwide trade in these endangered animals because they are ignorant about sea turtles. 
                  As in many other nations, it is against the law to purchase, sell, or import anything related to sea turtles in the United States.

<h4>Commercial Fishing</h4>

<table>

        <td><img src="fishing.jpg" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 700px;"></td>
        <td>
<p>Every year, thousands of adult and young sea turtles are captured by small-scale fisherman in global waters.
     Estimates of yearly capture, damage, and death are staggering, with 150,000 turtles murdered in shrimp trawls, 200,000 hurt or killed by longlines, and many more dying in gill nets.
     <br>
     <br>
     Gill nets are used to capture sea turtles, but the extent of their mortality is difficult to measure due to the variety of fishing methods used.
      These methods include trawls, pound nets, pot fisheries, and hand lines.</p>

<h5>Climate Change</h5>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <p>The effects of climate change are anticipated to have a disastrous effect on sea turtles since they utilise both marine and terrestrial behaviors throughout their life cycles. 
                Nesting beaches are impacted by climate change. Beaches are beginning to disappear as a result of melting polar ice caps and increasing sea levels. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The size of nesting beaches shrinks as the sea level starts to rise. The erosion of coastal ecosystems will continue as a result of stronger storms that are anticipated as a result of rising temperatures. 
                The gender ratio of sea turtles may suffer from higher temperatures. More female sea turtles might result from higher incubation temperatures, which would restrict their ability to reproduce and genetic variety.

<h6>Oil Spills</h6>

        <td><img src="oil.jpeg" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 700px;"></td>
        <td>
<p>Marine pollution, such as oil spills and urban runoff from chemicals, fertilizers, and petroleum, can have a serious impact on sea turtles and their food.
     Pollution can kill aquatic plant and animal life when it enters the ocean, and as the pollutants degrade in size, the poisons released become more concentrated.
     As a result, numerous links in the food chain, including sea turtles, eat these tiny, more deadly particles.</p>
