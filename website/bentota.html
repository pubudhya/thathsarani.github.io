      Conservation efforts: <br>
      The turtle hatchery is essential to the survival of marine turtles. 
      The hatchery protects eggs from predators and human activity by gathering them and transporting them to secure locations. 
      When the eggs hatch, the hatchlings are carefully supervised turtle releases before being released into the ocean.
